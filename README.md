# Earth Engine Accessibility Map Creation Tool

This tool was created to accompany the paper "A global map of travel time to cities to assess inequalities in accessibility in 2015", [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25181) in Nature in 2018.

The tool allows users to create their own accessibility maps interactively, or using a CSV of target locations (the published map uses a fixed set of targets - urban areas and cities around the world). The tool is powered by Earth Engine and uses the friction surface from the published paper to calculate travel times. The resultant map can be viewed on a google maps interface, and then can be exported to a GeoTIFF file for local analysis in a GIS program.

The tool is online at access-mapper.appspot.com

The tool was created by Harry Gibson with CSS assistance from [Jake Ozga](https://www.jozga.co.uk/)
